        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li><strong>2 sets of 10 Wall Angels:</strong> Begin by standing with your back against a wall. Raise your arms so that your elbows are bent at a 90-degree angle. Keeping your arms in this position, slowly slide your arms up the wall as high as you comfortably can while maintaining contact with the wall. Now, lower your arms back down to the starting position while still maintaining contact with the wall.</li>
            <li><strong>2 sets of 10 Pelvic Tilts:</strong> Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Inhale, then exhale and engage your core muscles to gently tilt your pelvis upward. Hold it for a few moments, then release and gently lower yourself down.</li>
            <li><strong>2 sets of 10 Standing Leg Lifts:</strong> Sit on a stable chair with your back straight and lift one leg straight out in front of you. Hold for a few beats, lower it, and switch sides.</li>
